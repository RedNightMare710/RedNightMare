# 🏙️ Flashpoint Cities - Central City & Starling City Simulation

A unique and immersive city simulation featuring two interconnected cities with dynamic environments, realistic physics, and Flashpoint-inspired elements!

## 🌟 Features

### 🏗️ **Dual City System**
- **Central City** (Left side) - The bustling metropolis
- **Starling City** (Right side) - The modern urban center
- **Connecting Bridge** - Realistic bridge with supports and road markings

### 🚗 **Dynamic Traffic System**
- Real-time vehicle spawning and movement
- Traffic lights with realistic timing
- Vehicles traveling between cities across the bridge
- Speed Force effects with motion blur

### 🌦️ **Weather System**
- **Sunny** - Clear skies and normal conditions
- **Rainy** - Animated rain effects
- **Stormy** - Lightning strikes and dramatic atmosphere
- **Foggy** - Reduced visibility with fog effects

### 🌳 **Parks & Green Spaces**
- Central City Park with trees, benches, and fountain
- Starling City Park with matching amenities
- Realistic grass and vegetation
- Interactive park elements

### ⚡ **Flashpoint Features**
- **Speed Force Activation** - Press SPACE for super-speed effects
- Dynamic lighting and visual effects
- Time progression (day/night cycle)
- Interactive city elements

### 🏢 **Building System**
- Procedurally generated buildings
- Realistic window lighting (some lit, some dark)
- Varied building heights and colors
- Urban skyline effects

## 🚀 Installation & Setup

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.7 or higher
- pip package manager

### Quick Start
```bash
# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run the simulation
python flashpoint_cities.py
```

## 🎮 Controls

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `SPACE` | Activate Speed Force |
| `R` | Change Weather |
| `ESC` | Exit Simulation |

## 🎯 Unique Features

### 🌉 **Realistic Bridge Physics**
- Multi-level bridge deck
- Support pillars at regular intervals
- Road markings and lane indicators
- Vehicles smoothly transition across

### 🚦 **Smart Traffic Management**
- Synchronized traffic lights
- Realistic timing patterns
- Vehicle spawning from both cities
- Bridge traffic flow

### 🌆 **Dynamic Environment**
- Day/night cycle with sky color changes
- Weather transitions affect visibility
- Lightning strikes during storms
- Fog effects reduce visibility

### ⚡ **Speed Force Effects**
- Motion blur for vehicles
- Speed lines across the screen
- Enhanced visual feedback
- Temporary super-speed simulation

## 🏗️ Architecture

The simulation is built with a modular architecture:

- **Building System** - Procedural building generation
- **Vehicle System** - Dynamic traffic simulation
- **Weather System** - Environmental effects
- **Park System** - Green space management
- **Bridge System** - Inter-city connection
- **UI System** - User interface and controls

## 🎨 Visual Elements

- **Sky Gradients** - Dynamic day/night colors
- **Water Effects** - Realistic water rendering
- **Building Windows** - Individual lighting states
- **Park Elements** - Trees, benches, fountains
- **Weather Effects** - Rain, lightning, fog
- **Traffic Lights** - Functional signal system

## 🔧 Customization

The simulation is highly customizable:

- Adjust `SCREEN_WIDTH` and `SCREEN_HEIGHT` for different resolutions
- Modify `FPS` for performance tuning
- Change `BRIDGE_WIDTH` for bridge size
- Adjust vehicle spawn rates and speeds
- Customize weather probabilities

## 🌟 Why It's Better Than Flashpoint

1. **Dual City System** - Two interconnected cities instead of one
2. **Realistic Bridge** - Detailed bridge with supports and physics
3. **Dynamic Weather** - Multiple weather states with effects
4. **Interactive Parks** - Green spaces with detailed elements
5. **Smart Traffic** - Realistic traffic flow and management
6. **Speed Force Effects** - Enhanced visual feedback
7. **Day/Night Cycle** - Dynamic time progression
8. **Modular Design** - Easy to extend and modify

## 🎯 Future Enhancements

- Sound effects and music
- More vehicle types
- Pedestrian simulation
- Building interiors
- Emergency vehicle systems
- Seasonal changes
- Multiplayer support

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Pygame not found:**
```bash
pip install pygame
```

**Performance issues:**
- Reduce `FPS` value
- Lower vehicle spawn rates
- Disable some visual effects

**Display issues:**
- Check screen resolution compatibility
- Adjust `SCREEN_WIDTH` and `SCREEN_HEIGHT`
